This Java code represents an administrative control panel GUI application for managing user data and access records in a hypothetical system. Below is a detailed description of the code, including its core methods and functionality:

### Admin_GUI Class
- `Admin_GUI` is a class that extends the `JFrame` class, representing the main administrative control panel GUI.
- It provides a user interface for administrators to access and manage user data and access records.

#### Constructor:
- The constructor initializes the GUI window with a title, dimensions, and layout settings.
- It creates a panel with components for entering an admin ID and buttons for accessing user data and access records.

#### validateAdminId Method:
- `validateAdminId` is a method to check whether an input string matches the format of a valid admin ID.
- It uses a regular expression (`\\d{9}`) to verify that the ID consists of 9 digits.

#### isAdmin Method:
- `isAdmin` checks if a given ID belongs to an admin user by querying a database.
- It connects to the database, executes a query to retrieve the user type, and checks if it equals "admin."

### User Data Viewer Methods
- `displayUsersTable` and related methods are responsible for displaying and managing the user data viewer GUI.

#### displayUsersTable Method:
- `displayUsersTable` sets up the user data viewer GUI when the "User Data" button is clicked.
- It fetches user data from a database, creates a table to display it, and adds filter options.

#### createUsrTableFrame Method:
- `createUsrTableFrame` creates a JFrame to display the user data table.
- It sets up the table with column names, filters, and a custom button column for each user.

#### applyFilter Method:
- `applyFilter` filters the user data table based on the selected filter option (e.g., "All," "Admin," "Student," "Staff").

#### filterAccessRecordsBySearchText Method:
- `filterAccessRecordsBySearchText` allows users to search for records based on text input.

#### fetchUsersData Method:
- `fetchUsersData` retrieves user data from a database and returns it as a list of String arrays.

#### updateUsersTableView Method:
- `updateUsersTableView` updates the user data table with the latest data from the database.

### Access Records Viewer Methods
- Similar to user data viewer methods, there are methods for displaying and managing the access records viewer GUI.

#### createAdmTableFrame Method:
- `createAdmTableFrame` sets up the access records viewer GUI with filtering and search functionality.
- It fetches access records data from the database and displays it in a table.

#### displayAccessRecordsTable Method:
- `displayAccessRecordsTable` initializes the access records viewer when the "Access Records" button is clicked.

### Database Connection Methods
- `connectToDatabase` establishes a connection to a MySQL database.

### Data Fetching Methods
- `fetchUsersData` and `fetchAccessData` retrieve user data and access records data from the database.

### User Status Toggling
- The code includes functionality to toggle user statuses between "Active" and "Deactive" through buttons in the user data table.
- The `ButtonRenderer` and `ButtonEditor` classes handle the rendering and behavior of these buttons.

### Main Method
- The `main` method initializes the Admin_GUI class and makes it visible when the program is run.

This Java code creates a comprehensive administrative control panel with user and access records management features. It connects to a MySQL database to fetch and display data and allows administrators to interact with the data through a user-friendly GUI.
